!4 Element parameter test procedure

The test procedure does the following actions:
 1 Call the generic testData operation provided by the !-DataTest-! service provider with a statically defined value.
 2 Check that no error is raised by the provider, especially DATA_ERROR and BAD_ENCODING, meaning that the provider received the right value.
 3 Check the return value which must equal to the original value.

The generic testData operation of the !-DataTest-! service is defined as: Element testData(Element).

A list of MAL data structure instances is statically defined according to the following constraints:
 * All the data types shall be instantiated at least once.
 * Enumerations shall be instantiated once for each enumerated value.
 * Abstract types need to be extended by a concrete type for the test
 * The value Null shall belong to the list
 * The value Null shall be inserted into a Composite structure

This data list is statically known by the !-DataTest-! service provider and consumer.
The consumer takes the data from the list one by one, in the same order, and applies the test procedure.
