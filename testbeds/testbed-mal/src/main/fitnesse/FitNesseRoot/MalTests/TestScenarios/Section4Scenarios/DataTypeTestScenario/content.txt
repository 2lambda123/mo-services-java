!2 Data type test scenario

A single test case is defined for all the procedures used to check the MAL data types related assertions.

!3 Data type test case

Several test procedures are defined:
 * the explicit types test procedure checks the basic exchange of data values from a consumer to a provider and back. The widest range of values are checked.
 * the Element parameter test procedure checks the characteristics of all types to be a MAL Element.
 * the multi return test procedure explores the use of data values in operation parameters, depending on the complexity of the operation body.
 * the polymorphic types test procedure checks the extended polymorphic possibilities offered by the MAL type system.
 * the MO Object test procedure checks assertions related to the MO Object concept.
