!4 Multi return test procedure

The test procedure does the following actions:
 1 Call a specific operation provided by the !-DataTest-! service provider with a set of statically defined values.
 2 Check that no error is raised by the provider, especially DATA_ERROR and BAD_ENCODING, meaning that the provider received the right values.
 3 Check the return values which must equal to the original values.

The test operation of the !-DataTest-! service declares 4 input parameters and 4 return parameters. The objective is not to test all data types, as this has already been done with the ExplicitTypesTestProcedure. The objective is to check various use cases when the data is not the single return parameter. A specific operation is defined for each use case as the type of the declared parameter is important.
The tested use cases include:
 1 a set of explicitely defined types
 2 a set of parameters with the last one declared as Element
 3 a set of parameters with the 2nd and 3rd ones declared as Element
 4 a set of parameters including a NULL value
