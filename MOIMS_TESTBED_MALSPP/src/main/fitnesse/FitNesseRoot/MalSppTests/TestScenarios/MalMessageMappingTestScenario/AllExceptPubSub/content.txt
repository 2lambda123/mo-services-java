!3 All IPs except Pub/Sub test case

Reuse the MAL test procedure that does the following actions:
 1 Call the operation <ip> provided by the IPTest service with the parameters passed to the test procedures: 'ip', 'qos', 'session' and 'transition list id'.
 2 Wait for the expected transitions to be done, except the faulty ones that are ignored.
 3 Check the message headers
 4 Check the transitions

The space packet type is always 1 (TC). So the secondary APID and APID qualifier are used by the MAL header field 'URI From'.
The local APID and APID qualifier are respectively equal to 1 and 247.
The remote APID and APID qualifier are respectively equal to 2 and 248.
