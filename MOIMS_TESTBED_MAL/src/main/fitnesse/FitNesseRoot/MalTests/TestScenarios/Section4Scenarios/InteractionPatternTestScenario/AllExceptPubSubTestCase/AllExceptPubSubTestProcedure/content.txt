!4 Test procedure: <ip>/<qos>/<session>/<transition list id>
The test procedure does the following actions:
 1 Call the operation <ip> provided by the IPTest service with the parameters passed to the test procedures: 'ip', 'qos', 'session' and 'transition list id'.
 2 Wait for the expected transitions to be done, except the faulty ones that are ignored.
 3 Check the message headers
 4 Check the transitions

It is necessary to go through all the transitions of the IP state charts, the faulty transitions are underlined.
In the faulty case, the field 'errorCode' of the IPTestTransition is set to the value INCORRECT_STATE otherwise it
is set to "-1". The field 'Transition list id' is used to identify the test procedure.

The transitions are checked by ensuring that the faulty messages are not received by the consumer.
